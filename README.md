## Thresholds
### 1. File Descriptor
When you want to do input or output to a file, you have a choice of two basic mechanisms for representing the connection between your program and the file: **file descriptors** and **streams**. File descriptors are represented as objects of type `int`, while streams are represented as `FILE *` objects.

File descriptors (the ones we are using) are a positive integer handle used to identify an opened file at a very low level (kernel level). These are used for functions such as `read()` or `write()`. The intigers are positive as negative values are kept for error handling.

### 2. The Open and Read Functions
These are the basic functions which will be used during the project. The `open()` will be required for the main function, so the documents pointed as an argument are accessivel, and the `read()` will go through the lines. We will go deeper into each one.

#### a. Open
The `open()` system call opens the file specified by pathname. The pathname, for this project will generally be inputed through the standard input.

The return value is a file descriptor (the fd), which corresponds to a small, positive intiger to refere to the open file.

The argument flags must include one of the following access modes: `O_RDONLY` _(Read Only)_, `O_WRONLY` _(Write Only)_, or `O_RDWR` _(Read and Write)_. There are more flags, but for our use case, O_RDONLY, or even O_RDWR will suffice.

#### b. Read
The `read()` tries to read a file up to the count of bytes the buffer has. The read operation commences at the file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes read. If the file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.

If count is zero, `read()` may detect errors, as our program should. In the absence of any errors, or if `read()` does not check for errors, a `read()` with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.

The returns values are `-1` on errror, a positive intiger showing the `<amount of bytes>` read or `0` in case the end of the document (EOD) is reached.

### 3. Static Variables
Static variables have a property of preserving their value even during calls, and therefor they are not re-initialized again. That is the main use they have and characteristic you need to understand.

There are some particular properties to the static variables
- The values store in the static variable remains in the memory while the program is running.
- The memory allocation is done in the data segment, rather than the stack. For more details I highly recommend this [article, by G4G](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/), although it is not required for this project in particular.
- As global variables, static variables are already initialized to 0, and therefor they will not throw some random garbage.
- They need to be initialized whith constant literals. Returning values from functions won't work.

### 4. Buffer Size
>_"Your read must use the BUFFER\_SIZE defined during compilation to read from a file or from stdin"_

>_"Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER\_SIZE=xx. Which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls in your get\_next\_line. This value will be modified by your evaluators and by moulinette"_

Both this quotes from the PDF points us torward the use of the variable `BUFFER_SIZE` to define the amount of characters the function `read()` will go over, and remarks that it will test different sizes during the testing.

The project purpose here is to teach us how to define macros in the header to be used during the code. Instead of defining an intiger with its handle, a macro is define on the header to be used at any point of the project, rather than only in the scope we are. The flag `-D` from the second quote `-D macro[=defn]` is just to define this macro using the console while compiling the program. Here is the documentation about [gcc and the flag in particular](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)

Just a final note, the norminette requires the `ifndef - endif` protection to define macros.

### 5. Memory Management
This is another of the concepts introduced into this project and which is generally oversee until the end of the projects. With some luck, anyone reading this should be warning before wasting their points and even taking it into account from the beginning of the project.

As this function is suppose to run in a while, and even inside the function there is a while running until the EOD, a lot of strings are going to be allocated to pointers. Each time a new string is assign to one of this pointers, the previous memory the pointer was leading to needs to be freed, otherwise it will become unreachable, as there is nothing telling us where it is, and therefor there will be memory leaks. The proper way of dealing with this is by using a temporal variable (`tmp` or `temp` in my code) which, after being asigned to its final destination, it will be free.

Take it into a account and read about Valgrind if you are on Linux, or about Docker + Valgrind if at the 42 Macs, as theses are the best tools to test these kind of issues.

### 6. Multiple fd Reading
The Bonus of this project is a fairly easy one to obtain. It is enough to think about the documents as an array of documents, and therefor by adding `[<any number greater than 0>]` to the static variable it will be treated as a list and access to the document required.

This is a fun and relatively short project with a lot of insights and tidbits, and as much challeging it might seem, being the first project out of the function generation we are used to from libft and the piscine, it is the first one which requires a little bit of planning.
